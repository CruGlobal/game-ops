With the updated code, the contributor will receive:

- For 5000 Pull Requests:
    - 1 Bill for the first 10 PRs
    - 1 Vonette for the first 500 PRs
    - 1 Vonette for the first 1000 PRs
    - 50 Bills for every 100 PRs (5000 / 100)

- For 2000 Reviews:
    - 1 Bill for the first 10 Reviews
    - 1 Vonette for the first 500 Reviews
    - 1 Vonette for the first 1000 Reviews
    - 20 Bills for every 100 Reviews (2000 / 100)

Calculating the total number of bills:
- Each Bill counts as 1.
- Each Vonette counts as 5.

So, the total number of bills would be:
- 2 Bills (1 for PRs + 1 for Reviews)
- 4 Vonettes (2 for PRs + 2 for Reviews)
- 70 Bills for every 100 contributions (50 for PRs + 20 for Reviews)

Total bills = 2 * 1 + 4 * 5 + 70 * 1 = 2 + 20 + 70 = 92 bills.
